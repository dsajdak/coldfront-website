# ColdFront BoF at PEARC'25

Recently, staff from UB CCR have been collaborating with Harvard FAS RC,
Indiana University (IU), and Southern Methodist University (SMU) to begin the
process of creating an open-source ecosystem around ColdFront. In this BoF,
attendees will have an opportunity to hear about these developments and provide
feedback on our plans.

All three of these partner organizations have made significant investments in
customizing and extending ColdFront for their center’s use cases and are eager
to help grow the community around a product they now rely on.  As part of this
collaboration, the teams are working towards implementing a robust CI/CD
pipeline, a governance model, a developers guide, and a project roadmap.
