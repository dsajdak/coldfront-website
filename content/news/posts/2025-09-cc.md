# September Community Conversation

This month's meeting is Tuesday, September 9, 2025 at 11:30am ET.  Monthly community meetings are convened over Zoom to discuss topics of interest.  Usually there are no planned agendas and community members bring ideas and questions to share. This month we do have a big announcement and we'll be working on solidifying initial working groups.
