# June Community Conversation

ColdFront 2nd community meeting. No set agenda but from the last meeting people
expressed interest in storage plug-ins so bring your ideas, questions, and if
you already have one implemented we'd love to have you demo it. These monthly
virtual meetings will be an opportunity for members of the ColdFront user
community to come together and discuss all things related to this popular open
source application.

This meeting covered plugin demos, storage integration, and ColdFront best practices.
